About ESRGAN:

Real-ESRGAN aims at developing Practical Algorithms for General Image/Video Restoration.
We extend the powerful ESRGAN to a practical restoration application (namely, Real-ESRGAN), which is trained with pure synthetic data.

ncnn is a high-performance neural network inference computing framework optimized for mobile platforms. ncnn is deeply considerate about deployment and uses on mobile phones from the beginning of design. ncnn does not have third party dependencies.

This addon is the ncnn implementation of Real-ESRGAN in blender . 

This addon will only work on Windows Operating Systems (For Now).
